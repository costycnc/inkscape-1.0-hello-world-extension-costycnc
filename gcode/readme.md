This is an practical example for whose that want to learn the base of inkscape extension and transform a vectorial image to gcode!

Is not a finished and solid program ... is only a tutorial example with minimal lines of codes!

Need use function Menu > Path >Object to path (or stroke to path or bitmap to path) if your object is not path

Convert Path to gcode 3 axis machine X,Y,Z

put gcode.inx and gcode.py in C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\inkscape\extensions but if can give a error that file can not be write

put gcode.inx and gcode.py in C:\Users\YOUR_NAME_ADMIN\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions(after need to restart Inkscape)

after execute extension will find file gcode.nc in this folder C:\Users\YOUR_NAME_ADMIN\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions

gcode.nc will be rewrite any time

you find this extension in Inskape in Menu > Estensions > helloworld > gcode ( if not find this extensions in Menu ... mean that something go wrong!!!)
